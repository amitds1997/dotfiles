## Broken features

1. Fix the issue with volume widget. Volume starts off not playing. Only when I
   go to `pavucontrol`, do a `mute`-`unmute` does it start working
2. In all sections except search in the `applauncher`, `<Tab>` takes you on the
   next item after two presses. Also it disappears after going through the last
   item (only re-appearing after 7 presses right now)

## Pending cleanup

1. Combine widget CSS for `battery`, `audio`

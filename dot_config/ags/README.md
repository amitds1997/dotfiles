# AGS configuration

Continue from fixing why notification icons don't disappear

## Broken features

1. Fix the issue with volume widget. Volume starts off not playing. Only when I
   go to `pavucontrol`, do a `mute`-`unmute` does it start working

## Pending cleanup

1. Combine widget CSS for `battery`, `audio`

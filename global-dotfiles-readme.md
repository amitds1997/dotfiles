## ToDo list

### Looking out for

1. TUI-based AI Chat app (`crush` came close, but was slow :/)
2. Better docker TUI (`lazydocker` is okay-ish)

### Blocked

1. Automatic theme setting on both [`delta`][3] and [`lazygit`][4] together
2. Look for more use cases before spending time on `ast-grep` and `yazi`

### Pending

1. Setup `lazydocker`
1. Add `chezmoi` command to automatically loop over all paths and add any missing
   files as and when needed
1. Setup `1pass` and `bitwarden` workflows
1. In `kitty`, set up top tab page using Python script to handle stuff nicely.
   See: [megalithic/dotfiles][1]
1. In `kitty`, set up [startup session][2]. I guess we want:
   a. One tab dedicated to `dotfiles`
1. Test `ghostty` terminal
1. A database and AI Chat tool
1. better history management
1. Find ways to use fingerprint and passkeys more

### Under review

1. Setup a clipboard manager (For now, using `raycast` in-built clipboard)
2. Setup `raycast`

### Done

1. Test out `harlequin` â€” Did not like it, did not have enough features to spend
   more time there
2. Setup a process to set a bunch of files/directories in an order to VLC (in
   future, maybe another app)

   ```bash
   fd -0 'S01E([1-9][0-9])|S01E09' -e mkv | xargs -0 open -a VLC
   ```
